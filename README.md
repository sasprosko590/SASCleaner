### System Cleaning 🚮

The `clear` function manages the general cleaning process. It takes default folders, opens selected tools and deletes files in specified folders.

#### Notes

- I recommend to always set "Dism" to "true",
- I don't have any bad intentions, there is no bad software in the code, and there is no such thing as taking the user's name in the code.
- Update your drivers.
- Close unnecessary startup programs in the task manager.
- Empty the trash can.
- Check for windows updates.
- Clear your browsers' caches.
- Restart the computer each time the code terminates.
- Remember to set the power options to "High Performance" or "Ultimate Performance".,
- If you press the Windows key from the keyboard and type "Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows" in the search field and click on it, if you click on "Adjust for best performance" in the window that appears in front of you "Performance Options" and press "Apply" and exit, your computer will get better performance, and my settings are as follows;

- ✅ Custom:

- ✅ Show thumbnails instead of icons
- ✅ Smooth edges of screen fonts
- ✅ Use drop shadows for icon labels on the desktop

## Usage 🚀

- If you don't know anything you can look in the `index.test.js` file.
- If you don't know anything, you can do it by running `index.py` and confirming all the cmds that appear in front of you. (note: I got support from chatgpt because I am new to py. thanks chatgpt.)
